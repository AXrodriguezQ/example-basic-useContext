# React + Vite

# React useContext Basic

Very simple example of a counter that interacts with the entire global context of the application without many components and with a basic context to give simplicity and give a super basic and understandable example

## Instructions

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
$ npm run start
```

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
